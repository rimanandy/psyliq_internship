# Project 2:
An overview about the project:
This project focuses on using SQL to analyze and manage patient data related to diabetes and other health conditions. The main objectives are to retrieve and analyze various aspects of patient data, such as identifying patients with specific conditions, calculating averages like BMI, and ranking patients by their health metrics, or inserting new patient data.

Objectives:
-To Retrieve and Analyze Patient Data
-To group data and rank them 
-To select patients, listing patients by blood glucose levels, and finding those with hypertension and diabetes. 
-To group patients by smoking history, determine those with above-average BMI, and rank patients by blood glucose levels within gender groups.

# Project 3:
In this project, I aim to analyze and gain insights from a comprehensive dataset encompassing various aspects of employee demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and performance metrics. 
By leveraging tools like Power BI and Excel, I uncovered patterns, trends, and correlations within the data to inform strategic decision-making and optimize organizational effectiveness. From examining factors influencing employee attrition to understanding the impact of salary adjustments on income, my analysis endeavors to provide actionable insights that drive workforce management, improve employee satisfaction, and enhance overall business performance. Through thorough examination of the dataset and application of advanced analytical techniques, I seek to deliver valuable insights that empower stakeholders to make informed decisions and foster a thriving work environment.
